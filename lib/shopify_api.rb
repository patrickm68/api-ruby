module ShopifyAPI
  # 
  #  The Shopify API authenticates each call via HTTP Authentication, using
  #    * the application's API key as the username, and
  #    * a hex digest of the application's shared secret and an 
  #      authentication token as the password.
  #  
  #  Generation & acquisition of the beforementioned looks like this (assuming the ):
  # 
  #    0. Developer (that's you) registers Application (and provides a
  #       callback url) and receives an API key and a shared secret
  # 
  #    1. User visits Application and are told they need to authenticate the
  #       application first for read/write permission to their data (needs to
  #       happen only once). User is asked for their shop url.
  # 
  #    2. Application redirects to Shopify : GET <user's shop url>/admin/api/auth?app=<API key>
  #       (See Session#create_permission_url)
  # 
  #    3. User logs-in to Shopify, approves application permission request
  # 
  #    4. Shopify redirects to the Application's callback url (provided during
  #       registration), including the shop's name, and an authentication token in the parameters:
  #         GET client.com/customers?shop=snake-oil.myshopify.com&t=a94a110d86d2452eb3e2af4cfb8a3828
  # 
  #    5. Authentication password computed using the shared secret and the
  #       authentication token (see Session#computed_password)
  # 
  #    6. Profit!
  #       (API calls can now authenticate through HTTP using the API key, and
  #       computed password)
  # 
  #  LoginController and ShopifyLoginProtection use the Session class to set ActiveResource::Base.site
  #  so that all API calls are authorized transparently and end up just looking like this:
  # 
  #    # get 3 products
  #    @products = ShopifyAPI::Product.find(:all, :params => {:limit => 3})
  #    
  #    # get latest 3 orders
  #    @orders = ShopifyAPI::Order.find(:all, :params => {:limit => 3, :order => "created_at DESC" })
  # 
  #  As an example of what your LoginController should look like, take a look
  #  at the following:
  # 
  #    class LoginController < ApplicationController
  #      def index
  #        # Ask user for their #{shop}.myshopify.com address
  #      end
  #    
  #      def authenticate
  #        redirect_to ShopifyAPI::Session.new(params[:shop]).create_permission_url
  #      end
  #    
  #      # Shopify redirects the logged-in user back to this action along with
  #      # the authorization token t.
  #      # 
  #      # This token is later combined with the developer's shared secret to form
  #      # the password used to call API methods.
  #      def finalize
  #        shopify_session = ShopifyAPI::Session.new(params[:shop], params[:t])
  #        if shopify_session.valid?
  #          session[:shopify] = shopify_session
  #          flash[:notice] = "Logged in to shopify store."
  #    
  #          return_address = session[:return_to] || '/home'
  #          session[:return_to] = nil
  #          redirect_to return_address
  #        else
  #          flash[:error] = "Could not log in to Shopify store."
  #          redirect_to :action => 'index'
  #        end
  #      end
  #    
  #      def logout
  #        session[:shopify] = nil
  #        flash[:notice] = "Successfully logged out."
  #    
  #        redirect_to :action => 'index'
